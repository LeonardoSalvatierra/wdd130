      <p>Hello My name is Leonardo Salvatierra, and I'm from Argentina. I'm 26 years old and currently studying computer science at Brigham Young University, which is a dream come true for me. I've always had a passion for technology, and I'm excited to be pursuing a career in programming, where I can put my creativity and problem-solving skills to good use. In my free time, I love to cook and experiment with different ingredients and flavors, and I'm always looking for new recipes to try. I also enjoy playing sports like basketball, volleyball, tennis, and martial arts, which I've been practicing for several years. I find martial arts particularly rewarding because they require discipline, focus, and physical and mental strength. I'm committed to expanding my knowledge and skills in both programming and martial arts, and I enjoy taking on new challenges and learning from others. I'm happily married to Florencia Caballero, and family and friends are incredibly important to me. I believe that teamwork and collaboration are essential to success, and I'm always eager to contribute to projects and events in any way I can.</p>
